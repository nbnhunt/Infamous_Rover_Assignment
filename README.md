# The "Infamous" Rover Assignment
A dive into unit testing. When introduced, this particular assingment was touted as the first and largest of our hurdles. Indeed, it was required to pass this assignment to continue with class. Not everyone made it.

This can be found on my old Replit, where the first half of LaunchCode was conducted: https://replit.com/@nbnhunt/Mars-Rover-Autograded-powerSwitch#rover.js

The "powerSwitcher" part of the title references my solution. We were coding to detect specific thresholds in the state of the "rover". I separated and layered elements of the states of the rover as built-in validation in addition to the unit testing. It was a simple if/then solution to the problem and passed all the bonus questions. I was proud of my top marks on this one.
